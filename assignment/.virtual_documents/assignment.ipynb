# It seems most 2-year universities are public. 4-year universities, on the other hand, are largely private, not-for-profit. There are minimal 2-year private universities not-for-profit. If private, they tend to be for-profit.

# The 4-year private not-for-profits stand out in this graph. There is a much stronger correlation between aid_value and grad_100_value than the generic plot from earlier.
# For 4-year private not-for-profit universities, the more aid_value increases, the higher the grad_100_value increases.
